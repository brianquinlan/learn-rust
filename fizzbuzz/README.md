# FizzBuzz

## Problem

Prints the numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is a evenly divisible by
3 then print ```Fizz``` instead. If the number is evenly divisible by 5
then print ```Buzz``` instead. If the number is evenly divisible by both
3 and 5 then print ```FizzBuzz``` instead.

For example:

    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    ...
