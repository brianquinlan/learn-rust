# Find a Pair of Integers that Sum to a Specified Value

## Problem

Find a pair of integers in a list of integers whose sum matches a specified
value. The order of the integer list is arbitrary. If there are several
matching pairs then it is acceptable to return any one.

For some reason hash tables may not be used in the solution.

For example:

    list: 2, 8, 23, 18, 4, 3, 5, 11
    target: 13
    => 8, 5 (or 2, 11)
